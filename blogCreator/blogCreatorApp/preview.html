      <p>In another example, when a customer makes a purchase online from Dell Computer, the
        supply chain includes, among others, the customer, Dell’s Web site, the Dell assembly plant, and
        all of Dell’s suppliers and their suppliers. The Web site provides the customer with information
        regarding pricing, product variety, and product availability. Having made a product choice, the
        customer enters the order information and pays for the product. The customer may later return to
        the Web site to check the status of the order. Stages further up the supply chain use customer
        order information to fill the request. That process involves an additional flow of information,
        product, and funds among various stages of the supply chain.
        These examples illustrate that the customer is an integral part of the supply chain. In fact,
        the primary purpose of any supply chain is to satisfy customer needs and, in the process, generate profit for itself. 
        The term supply chain conjures up images of product or supply moving
        from suppliers to manufacturers to distributors to retailers to customers along a chain. This is
        certainly part of the supply chain, but it is also important to visualize information, funds, and
        product flows along both directions of this chain. The term supply chain may also imply that
        only one player is involved at each stage. In reality, a manufacturer may receive material from
        several suppliers and then supply several distributors. Thus, most supply chains are actually
        networks. It may be more accurate to use the term supply network or supply web to describe the
        structure of most supply chains, as shown in Figure 1-2</p>
